### Change account type

You can change your account type at any time in the future. This can be done by clicking the ‘**Change package**‘ button on [the dashboard](/the-dashboard.md). Or you can change your producer/non producer status and and profile/shop package by selecting **Enterprise **on the blue horizontal banner, and then editing your enterprise’s settings \(see below\).
