## What is an online farmer's market? {#what-is-a-producer-shop}

Farmers’ markets are physical markets that run periodically in urban and regional areas to improve access to local food and to give producers an opportunity to market directly to consumers. It's possible to add an online element onto these markets, to increase reach.

## There are 3 ways Farmer's Markets can get online with OFN:

### Profile only

The farmer's market can create a hub profile for their market using the [Hub (profile only) guide](/hub-profile-only.md). Each farmer within the farmers market can create their own profile as well, using the[ producer (profile only) guide](/producer-profile-only.md). This gives visibility to the market, and the stallholders on the OFN directory.

### Group page
The market may wish to create a group page, which acts as a directory of their stallholders. This mini-directory includes a map with profiles of all producers. It can be embedded into the farmer's market's website, and it lets customers learn more about the producers. An advantage is that each producer can setup and maintain their own profiles, minimising central administration.

### Independent producer shops
A stallholder can independently setup a producer shop on OFN (see [Producer Shop guide](/producer-set-up-guide.md)). They may use this to take pre-orders for pickup at the market, or for delivery after the market. The market can encourage stallholders to expand their sales in this way, and promote their online shops.

### Collective Market Shop
Farmer’s market stallholders who are willing to cooperate and work together can establish a collective shop, or a hub shop. This hub has a single shopfront offering the entire product range of participating producers. Finding a way to coordinate the logistics of incoming and outgoing products can require some creative thinking, but using the farmer’s market days as a chance to aggregate and pack orders is one simple option. From there orders can be taken to alternative drop off points, or to hospitality/corporate customers who don't attend the market in person.
