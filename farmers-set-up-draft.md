## What is an online farmer's market? {#what-is-a-producer-shop}

Profile only

_Each farmer within the farmers market can establish their own profile and online shop on the OFN. The farmers market’s website could then promote links to these independently run shops._

Grouppage

_This is an umbrella profile, which can house the profiles and stores of member producers. With a unique URL and landing page, this group site allows for collective marketing and promotions._

Hub

_Farmer’s market groups who are willing to cooperate and work together can establish a hub. This hub has a single shopfront offering the entire product range of participating producers. Finding a way to coordinate the logistics of incoming and outgoing products can require some creative thinking, but using the farmer’s market days as a chance to aggregate and pack orders is one simple option._
