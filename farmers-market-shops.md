# Farmer's Market Shops

## How can a Farmer's Market sell online?
Farmers markets have huge opportunity to not only act as a space for physical sales, but also as a node, or an aggregation point to reach customers who are ordering online. 

Some of the ways farmer's markets can reach beyond the physical market space:
* Stallholders can offer online pre-ordering/pre-sales for products, for collection at the market
* Stallholders can use their trip into town/the city as an opportunity to distribute online orders to customers.
* Stallholders may wish to collaborate and open an collective shop, and use the market as an aggregation point for packing orders. They may also collaborate on delivery.
*  The market may wish to coordinate an online shop, stocking products from all the stallholders, for customers who do not attend the market - for example hospitality, institutional or other customer who prefer home delivery.

### Group page with profiles

The farmers market has their interactive group page setup, with full profiles for all of their markets and stallholders. With this model, there are no online shops as part of the group. The instructions above describe the setup of this model.

### Group page with profiles and producer shops

As above, the farmers market has their interactive group page, with full profiles for all of their markets and stallholders. In addition some producers will also operate independent online shops, which may provide pre-ordering for collection at the market, or delivery options for customers who cannot attend the market. They may also have sales which are completely separate from the market, such as sales in their local township.

### Group page with profiles, producer shops and a farmers’ market hub shop

The OFN’s high degree of flexibility makes it possible for collectives of enterprise to easily setup, trial and operate a great variety of collaborative sales arrangements. Two configurations, are covered below, however if you have questions regarding any other models don’t hesitate to get in touch.

**Collective online shop, without central coordination by a farmer’s market**

A group of stallholders will open a shopfront which stocks products from multiple producers. Here customers can place orders for items across multiple stallholders rather than needing to place orders with each stallholder separately. The participating stallholders will devise a means of coordinating the packing and delivery of these orders. It might be that each stallholder bags and labels their component of the orders, ready to pack into boxes on market day. Or perhaps they will alternate in the task of walking between stallholders at the end of the market at picking up the required items. Orders may be delivered by the stallholders after the market, back in their home locale, or around the market. Or alternatively, a storage and collection agreement may be made with a nearby cafe or shop.

** With coordination by the Farmers’ Market.**

A representative of the farmers’ market may take responsibility for coordinating an online shop, which sells items from multiple stallholders. Each week they’ll be tasked with checking availability of stock, opening the shop, packing the orders on market day and arranging delivery. This model is often pitched at customers who cannot attend the market, such as local workplaces or cafes and restaurants. This model may require some market facilities such as a cool room. The coordinator will also take responsibility for managing payments from customers and for paying the stallholders their share. Enterprise fees can be used to allocate a certain mark-up to the coordinator for their services.

OFN allows for piloting of different models easily and quickly, talk to us if you have another idea.
