# Private Shopfront

If you don’t want your shopfront to be visible to the public, or for anybody to be able to place an order with you, there are two ways that you can make your shop more private.

## 1\) Make the shop invisible

In your [Enterprise Settings](/Enterprise-settings.md), under Primary Details, you can set your profile to 'invisible'. When you are invisible your profile will not show on the OFN map and directories. Further, you shop will not show on the OFN Shops directory. The only way that people will be able to navigate to your shop is if you provide them with the URL. 

This can be a simple way to limit the number of new visitors who see, and place an order in your shop. 

> Note:  A disadvantage to this approach is that you're no longer visible in the OFN directory, making you less visible in the local fair food movement.

## 2\) Visible to registered customers only

A stricter, but more time consuming approach is to set your shop to be only visible to your known customers. This feature is useful for those operating membership based coops, or wholesale shops. When you opt to have a private shopfront, only customers whose email is on your Customer list will be able to login and view your shop and place an order.

To set this up, you should first maintain your **Customer **list.

The list will include all customers who have previously placed an order in your shop. You can also add customers manually, at the bottom of the list. Then in future, if they come to shop with you, they’ll be permitted.

You can also delete customers who you no longer want to be able to see your shop.

After updating your customer list, you can set your shopfront to private. Go to you **enterprise settings &gt; Shop Preferences **and select ‘**visible to registered customers only**‘.
