# Profile types

_Time: 10 min_

When you first create your profile, you’ll be prompted to select the ‘type’ of profile you want. Your selection here dictates the functionality that your profile will have.

%accordion%For producers these are your options%accordion%

1. **Producer profile – connect through OFN: **
This option allows you to create a profile on the OFN. Your profile is a way for you to share your story with others and makes you visible and contactable to customers and other enterprises who may wish to trade with you. A producer with a profile can also add products, which may be stocked in other OFN shopfronts.
2. **Producer Shop- sell your own produce: **
This option allows producers to create their own OFN shopfront through which to sell their produce. Note that producers can conduct sales through their own shopfront and simultaneously act as a supplier to another shopfront.
3. **Producer Hub- sell produce from self and others: **
This option is for producers who wish to sell their own produce, as well and products created by other producers.
