# Package types

When you first create your profile, you’ll be prompted to select the package you want. Your selection here dictates the functionality that your profile will have i.e. whether you'll just have a profile, or also have a shop. Different packages may also have different fee structures, depending on how your local instance charges.

## For Producers

_\* Note: The above is an example only, fees vary between OFN instances/countries._

1. **Producer profile – connect through OFN: **
   This option allows you to create a profile on the OFN. Your profile is a way for you to share your story with others and makes you visible and contactable to customers and other enterprises who may wish to trade with you. A producer with a profile can also add products, which may be stocked in other OFN shopfronts.
2. **Producer Shop- sell your own produce: **
   This option allows producers to create their own OFN shopfront through which to sell their produce. Note that producers can conduct sales through their own shopfront and simultaneously act as a supplier to another shopfront.
3. **Producer Hub- sell produce from self and others:  **
   This option is for producers who wish to sell their own produce, as well and products created by other producers.

## For Non-Producers \(Hubs\)

   : This option provides you with a complete online store for your hub, in addition to the profile.
