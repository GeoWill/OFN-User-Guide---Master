# Model Specific Setup Instructions


To help you navigate this user guide, we've created setup guides based on who you are and what you want to do with the Open Food Network. Find that guide that best suits your needs:

## I'm a producer
and want to:

* Only **be visible** and present myself here. I do not (yet) wish to sell my produce via OFN.

-->  You suit a Producer Profile: 

%accordion%What is a Producer Profile?%accordion%

A profile on the OFN is the simplest option, and offers a way for producers to market themselves. The profile can be used to promote your products and services, share your story and provide contact details. A profile makes you visible and contactable to customers and other enterprises who might wish to trade with you. Producers with a profile can also add products, which hub enterprises can then stock in their stores.

* **Sell my own goods** I grow/raise/brew/create/bake 

--> You suit a Producer Shop

%accordion%What is a Producer Shop?%accordion%

An OFN shop, is like a profile, but it also includes all the functions needed for producers to sell directly to customers online. This includes the online shopfront with full checkout capabilities as well as behind the scenes tools to aid in administration, such as reporting of payments and inventory. The OFN is a network, so it allows shops to be connected with other shops. This way a producer can be stocking their products in their own independent store, as well as through a number of hub shops.
