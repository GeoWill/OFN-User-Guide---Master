# Model Specific Setup Instructions


To help you navigate this user guide, we've created setup guides based on who you are and what you want to do with the Open Food Network. Find that guide that best suits your needs:

## I'm a producer
and want to:

%accordion%Only **be visible** and present myself here. I do not (yet) wish to sell my produce via OFN.%accordion%

-->  You suit a Producer Profile: 

%accordion%What is a Producer Profile?%accordion%

A profile on the OFN is the simplest option, and offers a way for producers to market themselves. The profile can be used to promote your products and services, share your story and provide contact details. A profile makes you visible and contactable to customers and other enterprises who might wish to trade with you. Producers with a profile can also add products, which hub enterprises can then stock in their stores.

%accordion%What is a Producer Shop?%accordion%

An OFN shop, is like a profile, but it also includes all the functions needed for producers to sell directly to customers online. This includes the online shopfront with full checkout capabilities as well as behind the scenes tools to aid in administration, such as reporting of payments and inventory. The OFN is a network, so it allows shops to be connected with other shops. This way a producer can be stocking their products in their own independent store, as well as through a number of hub shops.

## I'm a farmer's market
and want to:
- let each farmer have their own profile and/or shop

--> choose one of the '_I'm  a producer_' options for each farm

%accordion%How does this work?%accordion%

Each farmer within the farmers market can establish their own profile and online shop on the OFN. The farmers market’s website could then promote links to these independently run shops.

%/accordion%

- house the personal producer profiles and shops together on one group page 

--> get a group page

%accordion%What is a group page?%accordion%

This is an umbrella profile, which can house the profiles and stores of member producers. With a unique URL and landing page, this group site allows for collective marketing and promotions.

%/accordion%

- sell the entire product range of all our producers together via a single online shop.

--> establish a Farmer's market Hub

%accordion%What is a Farmers' market Hub?%accordion%

Farmer’s market groups who are willing to cooperate and work together can establish a hub. This hub has a single shopfront offering the entire product range of participating producers. Finding a way to coordinate the logistics of incoming and outgoing products can require some creative thinking, but using the farmer’s market days as a chance to aggregate and pack orders is one simple option.

## I'm a buying group
and want to:
- have an online shop to stock items from my various suppliers

--> You suit a Hub Shop

%accordion%How does this work?%accordion%

[Buying groups](/consumer-buying-groups.md) can use the OFN to setup an online shopfront, which can be stocked with items from their various suppliers. Each supplier has a corresponding profile, so as customers are shopping, they can learn about how their food was produced and where it’s come from. Different elements of the buying group’s shop can be configured, including whether it is member-only, what kind of markup is applied, how often its order cycles repeat and what shipping methods and payment terms are offered. Using the OFN within a buying group is a great way to streamline your administration tasks and to provide a more enjoyable shopping experience.
