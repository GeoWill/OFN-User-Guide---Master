#Producer Profile# 

## What is a producer profile?
- It's a place to tell your story...
- You'll be visible on the OFN map.
- You'll be visible in the producer directory.
- You can add in your products and be stocked in a shop on OFN.
- If you ever want to run your own shop, you can add the shopfront functionality to your profile.

## What does it do?
**Makes you visible**
When you have a profile on the Open Food Network, you become visible in your local food movement. You become contactable to customers who want to access your products. And you become reachable to other enterprises who may want to collaborate or distribute with you.

**Lets you supply others**
If you want to supply a shop on the Open Food Network, you can create your profile, and then upload your product range. The shop you supply can then see your products and add them to their shopfront.

## Steps for setting up a Producer Profile

1) [Register your profile](/create-an-account.md) on Open Food Network. This setup tool will ask for basic information about your enterprise to create your profile. You'll be prompted to confirm your email address.

2) Select the 'producer profile' [package type](/hub-profile-types.md).

**Your basic profile is now complete!
**
3) If you want to edit your profile, or add further detail you can modify your [Enterprise Settings](/your-profile.md).

**If you want to supply a shop on OFN**

4) [Add your product range](/products.md).

5) Grant the shop you want to supply with [permission to stock your products](/enterprise-to-enterprise-permissions-e2es.md).
