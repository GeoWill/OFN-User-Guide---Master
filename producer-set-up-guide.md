### Steps for producers selling on the OFN, either as a supplier, or through an online shopfront.

If you have selected to have a profile only account and don’t wish to trade on the OFN you can stop at step 4. If you wish to sell your products as a supplier to other OFN shops, continue to step 5 to add your products, and then you are ready. Producers who have selected to operate their own OFN shopfront should continue with steps 5-11.
